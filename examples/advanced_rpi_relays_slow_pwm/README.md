# Slow PWM

This example is a bit more complex. It is being used with https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JF4D814, and with the example rpi_relays.json file in /etc, it lets you configure and set up PWM for several relays. It is not meant to be fast, the target use case is to control floor heating, with cycle time of 10 minutes or so.
